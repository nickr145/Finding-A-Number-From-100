# Finding-A-Number-From-100


The  main purpose of this program is to find all the numbers from 1 - 100
in a 10 by 10 box. All of the numbers are randomly scattered throughout this box.

The numbers do not repeat, so in other words, all the numbers are unique inside this box.

When you find the number that the program asks for, you must input the row and column number where it exists.
Rows go from: 0 --> 9
Columns go from: 0 --> 9



If you locate the number correctly, you can go onto the next number.
If you locate incorrectly, you must retry until you get it correctly.

When you locate a correct number, that number will be replaced by a 0

Good luck finding all the numbers!
